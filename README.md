# validateruleimporter

Creates rules based on dataset properties to put into validate

The idea of this package is that it suggests rules for your dataset by checking the dataset. 

Workflow: 

1. a dataset in the way you like your data
2. create rules based on that dataset
3. generalize where possible
4. select the rules that you want to keep
5. import them to use with the validate package
