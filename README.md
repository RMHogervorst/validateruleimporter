# validateruleimporter

Creates rules based on dataset properties to put into validate

The idea of this package is that it suggests rules for your dataset by checking the dataset. 

Workflow: 

1. a dataset in the way you like your data
2. create rules based on that dataset 
      possibly on basis of [summarize_dat](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/summarize_dat) package
3. generalize where possible
4. select the rules that you want to keep
5. import them to use with the validate package
